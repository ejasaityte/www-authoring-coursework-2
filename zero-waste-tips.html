  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#FAQ1" class="btn btn-info btn-primary btn-block">What is a vegan?</button>
  <div id="FAQ1" class="collapse">
    <p class="FAQItem">Vegans avoid eating all foods of animal origin: meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, and honey. Veganism was originally defined purely as a dietary choice, but many vegans extend this ethic to shun animal testing and ingredients from all things they consume or wear, including clothing, shoes, personal care items, cosmetics, and medicine.</p>
  </div>
  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#FAQ2" class="btn btn-info btn-primary btn-block">What alternatives exist for meat, dairy products, eggs, and fish?</button>
  <div id="FAQ2" class="collapse">
    <p class="FAQItem">There are fantastic vegan alternatives to meat, fish, eggs, and every sort of dairy product you could want, from ice cream to yogurt to coffee creamer. These vegan products are so appealing that agribusiness interests have resorted to having their lobbyists seek to forbid the use of words like milk and beef on vegan items.</p>
  </div>
  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#FAQ3" class="btn btn-info btn-primary btn-block">Which books and cookbooks should I read?</button>
  <div id="FAQ3" class="collapse">
    <p class="FAQItem">Great new titles are constantly appearing. We regularly update our pages listing recommended books and cookbooks. Make sure your first vegan cookbook is one that's entirely devoted to quick and easy recipes. A few top choices:
<br>
<br>
The Simply Vegan Cookbook, by Dustin Harder

  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#FAQ4" class="btn btn-info btn-primary btn-block">How easy is it to eat vegan at restaurants?</button>
  <div id="FAQ4" class="collapse">
    <p class="FAQItem">Not only are vegan restaurants increasingly common, you can often get a reliably vegan meal at a wide variety of restaurants. The more you learn about the vegan dishes associated with various cuisines, the better you'll know your options. There is a vast variety of satisfying vegan food available at fast food franchises, gourmet restaurants, and everything in between. The websites of most restaurant chains will feature the ingredient list for each menu item.</p>
  </div>
  <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#FAQ5" class="btn btn-info btn-primary btn-block">Can vegans get sufficient protein?</button>
  <div id="FAQ5" class="collapse">
    <p class="FAQItem">You can get plenty of protein on a vegan diet, but it's also easy to come up short if you aren't paying attention. To make sure your needs are being met, check out our article titled Protein Requirements for Vegans.

While many foods contain little or no protein, there are plenty of delicious vegan foods that are rich in this key nutrient. Including foods like beans, nuts, and tofu with most meals will greatly increase your overall protein intake.</p>
